# Code Skill

This repository contains a single stack-agnostic skill focused on high-quality code creation with AI agents.

## Goal

Provide practical, enforceable instructions so an AI coding agent behaves like a rigorous technical lead:

- architecture first
- clean separation of responsibilities
- DRY and maintainability
- strict verification before delivery
- continuous repository hygiene

## Repository Structure

- `SKILL.md`: the core skill document, written in a reusable format inspired by high-quality open skill repositories.

## Source Basis

This skill was synthesized from the curated research material you organized in:

- `/home/imc/Documentos/OpenCode/Code Skill Data/01-fontes-originais-sessao`
- `/home/imc/Documentos/OpenCode/Code Skill Data/02-fontes-extraidas-links-sessao`

## Notes

- The content is platform-agnostic by design.
- No platform-specific command syntax (Claude/Cursor/etc.) is required to use this skill.
